Linked list:

 Diff: Array is a single block of memory with partition. Linked list is nothng but multiple blocks of memory linked
        with each other.

Limitations in array:
 -> Fixed size
 -> contiguous block of memory.
 -> insertion and deletion operation is costly.

Advantages of linked list:
 -> not fixed size
 -> non contiguous memory
 -> insertion and deletion is easier.


Linked List contains block of memory called Node. Node contains data and next. Next stores the address of next node.
 Head pointer stores the address of the first node of linked list.
