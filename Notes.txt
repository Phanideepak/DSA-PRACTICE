Data types:

1.) Primitive type: int, float, char, boolean, short int, long int.
2.) Derived type: Function, array, pointer, reference.
3.) User defined: class, structure, union, enum

1 bytes = 8 bits.
Int -> 4 bytes.
char -> 1 bytes.
bool -> 1 bytes.
unsigned integer range :  0 to 2 ^32 -1 
signd integer range : -(2 ^ 31) to (2 ^ 31 - 1) 

Operators:

1.) Binary operators: +, - ,*,/, %
2.) Unary operator:  ++, --
3.) Bitwise operator: &, |, ^,~  (operates on bits ) (AND,OR,XOR,ones complement)

 preincrement operator (++a): increment a instantly.
 post increment operator (a++): current value of a is preserved temporarily, a will be incremented before next statement execution.

 Function calls:

   1.) When the function is called, the function signature and local variables are stored as stack frame in LIFO order in the memory.
       Top most frame is the active frame. When function is getting called, it will be added as frame to memory stack and if function 
       returns- frame will be popped from memory stack.


 Time Complexity:

 1.) Indicates the time taken by algorithm to execute as funciton of input length.

 Space Complexity:
 1.) Corresponding to largest memory acquired by program at run time.

 Worst case -(big oh) notation
 Best case - (big omega) notation
 Average case - (big theta notation)

 Data types:

 1.) Array: It is list of variable of same type.

  pre requisite: Sub array -> continuous part of an array. No of sub arrays for array of size n is nc2 + n
                Sub sequence -> derived from an array by selecting zero or more elements without changing the order of remaining elements.
                No of elements = 2 ^ n.

Empty character ch = '\0'
