1.) Given an array of size n, For every i from 0 to n-1. Output max(a[0],a[1]...a[i])
2.) 
 pre requisite: Sub array -> continuous part of an array. No of sub arrays for array of size n is nc2 + n
                Sub sequence -> derived from an array by selecting zero or more elements without changing the order of remaining elements.
                No of elements = 2 ^ n.
 
 problem: Output sum of each subarray for array of size n.

 3.)For  a given array of n elements. find length of longest continuos arthimetic subarray?

 4.) Find number of special elements of array ?
     special element : It is greater than previous elements or greater than followng element.

5.) Find first repeating element of array. (element with least first occurence index)
