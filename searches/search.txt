Linear Search:

Input: Given array of n elements. You need to search an element k.

Logic: Traverse through every element and check whether element is equal to given key or not. 
       If it is equal then you return the index of that array element.

Worst time complexity = O(n)


Binary Search:

def binary_search(n,l,r,key)
   while(l<=r):
      mid = (l+r)/2
      if a[mid] == key :
         return mid;
      elif a[mid] > key :
         r = mid -1 
      else:
         l = mid + 1 
     
   return -1
