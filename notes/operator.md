Operators:

1. Bitwise Operators:  
   n << k  = n * 2^k
   n >> k  = n/2^k
   m & n  = and operation of respective binary representations.
   m | n  = or operation of respective binary representations.
   m ^ n  =  xor operator of respective bianry resp

   Example:   1 & 1 = 1
              1 & 0 = 0
              0 & 0 = 0

              1 | 1 = 1
              1 | 0 = 0
              0 | 0 = 0

              1 ^ 1 = 0
              0 ^ 0 = 0
              1 ^ 0 = 1 

2. Ternary Operator: booleanExp ? result1: result2
